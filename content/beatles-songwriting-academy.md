I recently discovered a [blog](https://beatlessongwriting.blogspot.com/) devoted to the Beatles’ songwriting techniques written by Matt Blick. It looks like there’s a lot of great stuff on there.

If you’re looking for simple ideas to spice up your songwriting, Beatles-style, take a look at his [Tickets to Write section](https://beatlessongwriting.blogspot.com/p/tickets-to-write.html), where he (concisely) describes 47 interesting moves found in the Beatles’ corpus.

Here are a few simple ones, which anyone following my [Practical Chord Progression series](/practical-chord-progressions/) might find immediately useful:

1. Use the minor iv instead of the major IV. Try it out; it has a familiar sound that you’ll never hear the same way again.
2.  Use the minor v instead of the major V. Again, very simple, but if used well this can generate just the right amount of surprise. 
3.  Try the [Picardy third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picardy_third). That is, when writing in a minor key, move to the major counterpart of your root chord at the end of a section or the entire song. So, if you’re in C minor, end the section on the C major chord. This is another instantly recognizable move, but one that can still be effective if used cleverly.
