Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or you’ve never written a song in your life, the following exercises can help you build, expand, and rethink your songwriting.

If you want to become a great songwriter, you have to practice writing music. But you’re going to make greater progress faster if you practice with purpose and awareness. That’s where my Practical Chord Progressions series comes in.

Does the word “theory” send chills down your spine? You’re in luck. If you follow this series from start to finish, you’ll develop a working grasp of some of the theory that matters without memorizing arcane formulas. You’ll be spending your time creating music instead of reading about it.

All the chords you need to know are listed here. If you’re a beginner, don’t worry. They’ll be introduced one at a time.

Finally, these exercise use a series of metaphors to describe the relationships between chords. Keep in mind that there are many other possible ways of thinking about these relationships. This series provides one useful starting point for exploring chord progressions.
